# scoutDSA296_postDataProcessing

MATLAB and R codes/scripts for post-processing recevied transmissions from wildlife computer SCOUT-DSA-296 tags.  See below for specific notes regarding the use of MATLAB scripts.

This code accompanies the paper: XXXXX.

Please note that these codes/scripts are availble as a guide to the sort of post-processing required with these data - the codes/scripts have not been generalised and de-bugged to work with other datasets than that used in the paper cited above.

Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions.

SPECIFIC NOTES FOR MATLAB SCRIPTS:

These were written useing MATLAB version R2011b.  The license was base software with the statistics and signal processing tool box.  However a number of functions were taken off the matlab file exchange and will need to be sourced for the codes/scripts to work.  Please let me know if I have missed any of these.
